# ReadME: Reading on the Go

## Overview 

For voracious readers, the internet can be a blessing and a curse. There are so many sites out there with so much great content, so many links to click, so many recommendations to follow. It's easy to end up with a seemingly endless collection of open browser tabs, and no time sitting at your computer to read them all. 

Enter ReadMe: an offline-first mobile app that—together with its [companion bowser extionsion](https://github.com/Project-Readme/ReadMe-browser-extension "extension repository")—allows a reader to save articles, blog posts, and other text from their desktop and retrieve that content later, all in one place on their mobile device. 

Articles downloaded from the remote database and saved locally on the user's device for offline reading. 

And if a user does run out of things to read, our app can help with that as well: the ReadMe home screen is pre-populated with continuously updated lists of the the most popular and most recent articles saved by everyone in ReadMe's community of users.

The ReadMe App was built using React Native, Redux, and Cloud Firestore.  

## Getting Started

This app is available on the [Expo](https://expo.io/ "Expo homepage") platform. After you have installed Expo onto your device you can run the app via [this link](https://expo.io/@tresarah/ReadMe-RN "ReadMe-RN on Expo"), or by building your own copy. 

To build you own copy, clone this repository to your local machine and install it with the [npm cli](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm "npm cli documentation") by running `npm install`.

With Expo install, you can then run `npm start` to launch the app.
