# ReadME: Reading on the Go

## Overview 

For voracious readers, the internet can be a blessing and a curse. There are so many sites out there, with so much great content, so many links to click, so many recomendations to follow—it's easy to end up with a seemingly endless collection of open browser tabs, and no time sitting at your computer to read them all. 

Enter ReadMe: an offline-first moble app that—together with its [companion bowser extionsion](https://github.com/Project-Readme/ReadMe-browser-extension "extension repository")—allows readers to save articles, blog posts, and other text from their desktops and retrive that content later for reading on their mobile device. 

Articles are downloaded from the remote database and saved locally on users' devices for offline reading until they decide to delete them. 

And if a user does run out of things to read, our app can help with that as well: the homepage of the app is pre-populated with most popular and most recent articles saved by everyone in ReadMe's community of users.

The ReadMe App was built using React Native, Redux, and Cloud Firestore.  

## Getting Started

This app is available on the Expo(https://expo.io/ "Expo homepage") platform. After you have installed Expo onto your device you can run the app via this link (the easier option,) or by building your own copy. 

To build you own copy, clone this repository to your local machine and install it with the [npm cli](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm "npm cli documentation") by running `npm install`.

With Expo install, you can then run `npm start` to launch the app.
